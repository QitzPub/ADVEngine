Mom, I probably don't need dinner today.

【ちとせの母】
Ok, where are you going?

【森若ちとせ】
….The summer festival.

(No, I don't think she's thinks that I'm a pain)

[森若ちとせ 笑顔]
【森若ちとせ】
I can really count on you.

【森若ちとせ】
If I was your pet, you would be THE owner I can brag about.

Really?

[藤枝アキラ 笑顔]
【藤枝アキラ】
Well, you'd need to be good girl for me to take care.

[森若ちとせ 驚き照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
Ah….

She screwed up my hair like petting a dog.

Don't worry about me. I am human you know, not a pet!

【藤枝アキラ】
…See.. That's why I'm worried since you're just pretending to be strong.

Oh…

I don't think Hashimoto is someone bad but

【森若ちとせ】
after what happened at the gokon, I'm just cautious when we're alone.

[藤枝アキラ 真顔]
【藤枝アキラ】
That's understandable.

【藤枝アキラ】
I'm not so good either when guys come closer to me.

[森若ちとせ 真顔]
【森若ちとせ】
I see..

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ]
【森若ちとせ】
(I've always wanted a boyfriend so bad)

【森若ちとせ】
(I thought it would be just fun…)

【森若ちとせ】
[bgm file="bgm006_e.wav"]
…I wish you were my boyfriend.

[藤枝アキラ 驚き]
【藤枝アキラ】
What?

Looking at Akira's widened her eyes,

I realize I just said something very stupid.

[森若ちとせ 驚き照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
Oh, no, I didn't mean it in a weird way. You're just really nice and reliable,

[森若ちとせ 真顔照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
and understands my feelings and I feel comfortable around you and

【森若ちとせ】
the times we spend together are all fun and happy moments,

【森若ちとせ】
so I just wished my boyfriend would be someone like that….

[藤枝アキラ 消 time=0]
[森若ちとせ 真顔]
【森若ちとせ】
(But that still means I wished she was my boyfriend….)

As I rushed to explain, I felt that I cleared my mind and

unbelievably it all makes sense to me.

[森若ちとせ 驚き照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
(I want to go out with Akira…?)

It felt like the feeling I had suppressed deep down suddenly was in the spot light.

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
(Oh my god…since when did I….)

My heart beats faster and faster and it feels difficult to breathe.

--Akira opens her mouth and says

If I was a guy, I would have probably fell for you too…

[森若ちとせ 驚き照れ]
【森若ちとせ】
Eh…

She looked serious and wasn’t joking. Just blushing.

Hehe.

I felt a stab of pain in my heart.

(I like her)

【森若ちとせ】
(Not just as friends but--)

[藤枝アキラ 消 time=0]
--I never thought I would fall in love with a girl and

I was in a pool of emotions of disbelief and anxiety.

At the same time, as I learned the truth about my feelings, my heart felt fulfilled and

strongly understood what falling in love means.
