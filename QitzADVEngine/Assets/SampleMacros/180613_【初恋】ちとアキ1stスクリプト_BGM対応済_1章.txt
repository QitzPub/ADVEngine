A A new term begins in the second year of high school

I think she'll just get annoyed if you suddenly started to talk to her?

Negative words towards Akira started pouring out.

(No, I didn't mean to backstab her)

Oh, but wait, I've never really talked to her so I don't think she's a bad person….

Too bad Akira couldn't come.

I felt that she's become more approachable now.

I decided to strike up a conversation.

The next day--.

Once homeroom finished and Mr. Minami went out of the classroom,

【女子生徒１】
[bgm stop]
the whispering started…

【男子生徒１】
Apparently someone saw them go into a hotel.

Seriously…?

[森若ちとせ 出 顔 制服(冬服) tb 驚き time=0]
【森若ちとせ】
(Why is everyone looking towards Akira….?)

[森若ちとせ 真顔]
【森若ちとせ】
What happened?

【女子生徒１】
Oh my god, I just heard it too but

【女子生徒１】
[bgm file="bgm006_c.wav"]
apparently Akira is doing compensated dating…!

[森若ちとせ 驚き]
【森若ちとせ】
What!?

I couldn't help almost shouting.

【森若ちとせ】
(Doesn't compensated dating mean to date older guys and….)

【女子生徒２】
Isn't that unbelievable!?

Whilst I was struck dumb, more students gathered around and gossiped.

【女子生徒１】
She looks so mature, it's possible right?

[森若ちとせ ふてくされ]
【森若ちとせ】
Hmm…..

【森若ちとせ】
(I still can't believe that Akira would do such a thing)

【男子生徒２】
Yeah, it kind of sounds true.

[藤枝アキラ 出 制服(冬服) up 半目 time=0]
【藤枝アキラ】
……

Some of the classmates were now starting to taunt Akira.

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ]
【森若ちとせ】
(Akira….!)

【女子生徒２】
 You know it's not so surprising.

【男子生徒１】
Yeah, a lot of the old guys must think she's hot!

The classroom was filled with laughter--.

[森若ちとせ 怒り]
【森若ちとせ】
[bgm stop]
It's NOT funny!

I couldn't hold back my anger anymore.

[藤枝アキラ 驚き]

【森若ちとせ】
[bgm file="bgm006_b.wav"]
You guys are extremely rude.

【森若ちとせ】
There are things you shouldn't say.

【男子生徒２】
But someone saw her right?

[森若ちとせ 真顔]
【森若ちとせ】
Yeah and is that someone in this classroom?

Everyone fell silent at my words.

[森若ちとせ 怒り]
【森若ちとせ】

Akira walks towards me with a look on her face.

【藤枝アキラ】
[bgm stop]
We only just got split into new classes and if you get on the wrong side,

【藤枝アキラ】
it would just get difficult for you.

[森若ちとせ 驚き]

【藤枝アキラ】

[森若ちとせ 驚き]

What….

[藤枝アキラ 真顔]
【藤枝アキラ】
They think it's true just because "I look like that kind of person".

【藤枝アキラ】
When I was in junior high, there was a rumor that I was doing some "shady job".

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ]
【森若ちとせ】
Oh no…I'm sorry to hear.

[藤枝アキラ 半目]
【藤枝アキラ】
It's ok.

I got used to it.

[藤枝アキラ 真顔]
【藤枝アキラ】
Look, you're not used to these things. So just stay out of it ok?

[森若ちとせ 笑顔]
【森若ちとせ】
You're so nice, just as I thought.

[藤枝アキラ ふてくされ照れ]
【藤枝アキラ】
…you're overestimating me.

【藤枝アキラ】
I'm not that nice.

She waved her hand as if to gesture I was out of my mind

but I can tell that her cheeks were slightly pink with blushing.

[森若ちとせ 驚き照れ]
