(I haven't talked at all with Akira…)

【森若ちとせ】
(Are we just going to become distant and then change classes again…)

No more lunches or going home together and

it became normal to spend time alone.

【藤枝アキラ】
Mr. Minami, would you help me with this problem?

【南啓一】
Ahh..this one…

My heart ache every time I see her talking to Mr. Minami.

[森若ちとせ 消 time=0]
It was hurting that

I couldn't talk to her like before and seeing her be with someone that wasn't me.

I quickly left the classroom to avoid facing the reality.

Right in front of me was Akira who I missed so much and

I almost dropped the cup from being so surprised to see her.

An awkward silence…

It hits me hard that I can't just talk with her like before.

[藤枝アキラ 消 time=0]
【森若ちとせ】
(--It seems like such a long time ago that we came to karaoke together)

【森若ちとせ】
(She was such a good singer…)

【森若ちとせ】
(And I probably will never be able to go with her and hear her sing again….)

I almost regret ending our friendship but 

there is nothing I can do.

【森若ちとせ】
(We might be friends anymore but)

【森若ちとせ】
What about that caf? we always used to go to. They apparently have a seasonal cake out now.

I put on my best smile and strike up a conversation.

[森若ちとせ 微笑]
【森若ちとせ】
[bgm file="bgm006_d.wav"]

【藤枝アキラ】
Hey Chitose, can we talk now?

[森若ちとせ 驚き]
【森若ちとせ】
Eh…

Contrast to my cheerful voice, Akira asked solemnly with a deep voice.

[森若ちとせ 半目]
【森若ちとせ】
(This must be about the other day…)

【森若ちとせ】
(I can't live if she say it's gross or that it's impossible…)

It still felt weird to go up to her and ask for it and

I felt so bad and didn't know what to do.

Mr. Minami looked at me with worrying eyes.

[森若ちとせ 半目]

(So calm and kind and mature…)

【森若ちとせ】

…Is everything ok between you and Akira?

As you teacher, it was very heart-warming to see you guys hang out so often but

[南啓一 悲しみ(眼鏡)]

I noticed that not so more these days.

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ]
【森若ちとせ】
…Oh.. Um.. There were a few things…

[南啓一 真顔(眼鏡)]
【南啓一】
I see…She looks really mature but sometimes it's hard for her to express herself.

[南啓一 微笑(眼鏡)]
【南啓一】
It could be annoying sometimes but if you can be patient with her.

[森若ちとせ 真顔]

I'm sorry I couldn't talk with you yesterday.

【森若ちとせ】
Not just that but for avoiding you too for a while and

it was must have been awkward for you. I'm really sorry.

[藤枝アキラ 出 制服(コート) up 悲しみ time=0]

It's ok..I didn't know what I should either…sorry.

As we apologize to each other, it seemed what was between us slowly melted away.

[森若ちとせ 真顔]
【森若ちとせ】
Maybe if I asked her to forget everything that said about my feelings,

【森若ちとせ】
it would be better for Akira but

I was hoping to become friends again.

【森若ちとせ】
Can we go back to the way before I told you my feelings…?

I honestly tell her and Akira frowned and l can tell she was thinking.

[藤枝アキラ 悲しみ]
【藤枝アキラ】
Since that day I thought long and hard about what you said.

【藤枝アキラ】
I couldn’t understand myself why I did that.

【森若ちとせ】
You mean when I tried to kiss you?

【藤枝アキラ】
Yeah…..

When you were so close to me and I knew if any closer we would be kissing,

"Your current situation" means your feelings for Mr. Minami?

And don't you remember I said it meant "cute"?
