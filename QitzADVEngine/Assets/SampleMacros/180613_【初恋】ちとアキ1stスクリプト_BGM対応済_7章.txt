Thanks to Akira's help, the school singing competition was a great success.

After school that day--.

【男子生徒】
Akira's such an awesome singer. Somehow unexpected and understandable.

【女子生徒】
I was so surprised too. Let's go to karaoke with her sometime.

(Since we've started practicing, it seems many people are now talking to her)

[藤枝アキラ 消 time=0]
--In the rain, Akira had reassured me that I'm her number one too.

Ofcourse I was thrilled but at the same time struck that our meaning was different and

my mind didn’t feel so clear.

【森若ちとせ】
[bgm file="bgm008_c.wav"]
(But I'm going to stop being jealous going forward)

【森若ちとせ】
(At the beginning of the term, there were weird rumors about her but)

[森若ちとせ 微笑]
【森若ちとせ】
(I want to stand by her as she makes lots of new friends)

[森若ちとせ 消 time=0]
I smile to myself as I see her surrounded by classmates and

walk towards the teacher's office to submit all our homework.

The girls who walked passed me said their goodbyes to Mr. Minami and

Oh, hey Chitose.

He noticed me and our eyes met.

Slightly taller than Akira with a gentle and deep voice.

[森若ちとせ 半目]

【森若ちとせ】
…Yes, we were really lucky that she helped us with the singing.

[南啓一 微笑(眼鏡)]

I guess she was trying to help you out Chitose.

[森若ちとせ 真顔]

Ahh, Akira told you.

【森若ちとせ】
Yes.

[南啓一 微笑(眼鏡)]
【南啓一】
She's not so approachable so I was worried a little to be honest but

[南啓一 笑顔(眼鏡)]
【南啓一】
it seems she integrated well into the class so I'm really glad.
