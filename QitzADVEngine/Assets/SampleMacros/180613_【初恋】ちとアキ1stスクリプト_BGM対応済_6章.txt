Once summer vacation was gone, preparation for the school festival started and

 as part of the class committee, I got extremely busy with all the related tasks.

(Tomorrow is the school festival and we still have a few things to do)

As we were doing the final checks,

【橋本】
[bgm file="bgm008_c.wav"]
Hey Chitose, got a minute?

【森若ちとせ】
Hey Hashimoto.

Even after the summer festival, a group of us from class hanged out a few times and

Hashimoto and I ended up bumping into each other during the vacation.

【森若ちとせ】
(I guess I'm less nervous than before talking to him now)

[森若ちとせ 微笑]
【森若ちとせ】
How are you?

【橋本】
Good, just wondering if we could walk around the festival togther?

[森若ちとせ 驚き]
【森若ちとせ】
Oh….

[森若ちとせ 半目]
【森若ちとせ】
[bgm file="bgm006_d.wav"]
(I was actually hoping to walk around with Akira….)

Even though I realized my feeling for Akira,

I still had left Hashimoto hanging in the air….

[森若ちとせ 悲しみ]
【森若ちとせ】
Sorry, I have the committee so don't think I can….

I try to politely say no--

[藤枝アキラ 出 制服(冬服) up 真顔 time=0]
【藤枝アキラ】
Well, I can go for you to the committee. Why don't you go?

[森若ちとせ 驚き]

I kill my feelings and look at Hashimoto

It's unfair to push all my work to Akira so

I can only go for a while but is that ok?

Sure! Let's have fun at the festival!

Anway, if you want to handle it by yourself, that's ok too.

She patted my head, as if she was complimenting a pet.

[森若ちとせ 半目照れ]

(Darn….my heart beats fast when she does something like that…)
